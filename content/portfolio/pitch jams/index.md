## Design system

We have developed a series of website plans that target a younger user base and are in line with the brand name.

### Colour scheme

**Primary: Goldenrod(#F6C555)**
<div style="background-color: #F6C555; width: 100px; height: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"></div>
Goldenrod is a medium shade of gold-yellow that’s both striking and gentle. As the primary background color for this project, it enhances the design’s vibrancy, harmonizes well with other colors, and complements user-uploaded materials.

**Secondary: Vibrant Pink(#E03C8A)**
<div style="background-color: #E03C8A; width: 100px; height: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"></div>

Vibrant Pink is a lively, bright shade of pink that exudes energy. It’s especially suited for younger audiences, capturing attention as an accent color and pairing well with softer tones for a relaxed visual experience.

**Tertiary: Soft Purple(#986DB2)**

<div style="background-color: #986DB2; width: 100px; height: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"></div>

Soft Purple is a refined and elegant shade of purple with a subtle gray undertone. It brings a sense of tranquility to a website and pairs seamlessly as a delicate accent with other hues.   

To maintain clarity, the background is pure white.

### Typography
- **Noto Sans** is the primary choice for many designers due to its lively and contemporary feel, making content approachable.
- **Roboto** for headers, this font brings a modern touch, ensuring that titles stand out with a relaxed yet fitting elegance.
