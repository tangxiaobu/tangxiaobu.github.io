## Introduction
**This is an assignment of using animals as the main feature to create an icon for a company, the end result requires three mildly modified versions of the icon targeting different devices. The first one is for itunes which requires higher level of details, the second one is for ipad, for this device midium level of details are needed, the last one is for iphone, the characteristics for this one is lower level of details, and in white and black.**

## Design
*My design of the icons are intended for a children's publisher. In order to align with the imaginative world of children's literature :*   
>I created this icon with a pig as the central element, aiming to challenge the conventional image we often associate with pigs. In this design, you will find a joyful pig skateboarding across a lush green field, with a vibrant sunset scenary. I chosen a shade of purple for the sky to evoke a surreal and dreamlike ambiance.
